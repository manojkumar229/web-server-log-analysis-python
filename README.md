# 📊 Data Analytics Projects by Manoj Kumar Desu

This repository contains two hands-on projects demonstrating data extraction, cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python and Power BI. These projects reflect real-world business use cases: web log monitoring and financial trading strategy evaluation.


## 🧠 Project: Web Server Log Analysis (Python)

### 🔍 Overview
This project involves analyzing a real-world web server log file (Apache format) to uncover traffic trends, error patterns, and usage behavior.

### 🗂️ Dataset
- **Source:** Calgary HTTP Dataset
- **Format:** `.gz` compressed Apache log file
- **Fields extracted:** IP address, timestamp, HTTP request, status code, response size

### 🚀 Features
- Parsed raw log lines using Python's `gzip` and `re` modules
- Structured log data into a DataFrame using `pandas`
- Cleaned and transformed datetime and request fields
- Answered key analytical questions:
  - Total number of log records
  - Unique IPs (hosts)
  - Top resources with 404 errors
  - Hourly and daily traffic
  - Bandwidth usage per day
  - HTTP status distribution
- Output stored in a clean and structured format suitable for further reporting or visualization

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas
- regex
- gzip
- datetime
